# Traffic Light Detection with YOLOv8

This project implements a Traffic Light Detection System using the YOLOv8 object detection model.
It detects traffic lights in real-world images under diverse lighting and weather conditions using the Small Traffic Light Dataset (S2TLD).

Project Overview
Objective: Build a deep learning model that detects traffic lights in images.

Dataset: Small Traffic Light Dataset (S2TLD) â€” 4,500+ images with XML annotations (Pascal VOC format).

Approach:

Convert annotations from VOC (XML) to YOLO format.

Apply data augmentation to improve robustness.

Train YOLOv8 model and fine-tune hyperparameters.

Evaluate model using mAP, precision, and recall metrics.
